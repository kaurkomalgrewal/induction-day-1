# induction-day-1

## 31 JULY 2025 THURSDAY 
### The first day was filled with excitement and energy, just like any new beginning. I was really looking forward to it.

The Student Induction Programme for the 2025 batch of Computer Science and IT started with the blessings of God through Shabad and Kirtan, followed by light refreshments and an official inaugural ceremony. The event reflected the college’s strong focus on values, discipline, and academic excellence.


The college welcomed us warmly with a thoughtful induction kit that included the college magazine, a notepad, a pen, and a keychain bearing the institute’s emblem.


During the ceremony, several speakers came forward and spoke about Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, which has a proud history of over 70 years. The Principal and Heads of Departments also addressed us, giving a warm welcome to the new students. They shared insights about the college's journey, its achievements, and what makes it stand out. They also introduced us to our chosen branches—Computer Science and Information Technology—talking about the scope, the curriculum, and the opportunities these fields offer.


Overall, the first day was a perfect start—full of information, inspiration, and the excitement of exploring a new chapter in life.
